If you're going degen (which I respect), consider 2% portfolio max with tight stops at -12%. I'm personally waiting for a pullback to 0.00000121 range before adding to my position.\n\nNot as explosive as my JITO call last month, but definitely not looking like a rug.

Social traction is artificially pumped - I'm seeing batch-created Twitter accounts all posting similar hype.\n\nStay far away from this garbage. Classic rug setup with artificial social signals.\n\nWant actual quality? Look at $PYTH's recent integration metrics or $RENDER's node expansion instead.

Technical approach:\n   - Enter on key support levels with volume confirmation\n   - Multiple time frame analysis before every entry\n   - Trailing stops at 0.5 ATR below local structure\n\n4. Sentiment edge:\n   - Track exchange inflows/outflows for institutional positioning\n   - Monitor developer GitHub activity as leading indicator\n   - Analyze community engagement quality not just quantity\n\n5. Risk management non-negotiables:\n   - No more than 15% portfolio in high-risk assets\n   - Clear invalidation points on EVERY trade\n   - Take partial profits at predetermined levels\n\nThis strategy kept me profitable through 72% market drawdown in 2022. Boring? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely.\n\nCurrently using this exact approach with my SOL allocation - 25% in SOL, 15% in ecosystem blue chips, 5% in carefully selected small caps, and 55% in stables waiting for optimal entries.\n\nRisk category: Conservative foundation with strategic degen allocations"

Account archaeology: Check follower accounts - sudden batches created within same 48hr window = red flag\n\n3. Uniformity patterns: Natural communities have varied message lengths/styles. Too similar = fabricated\n\n4. Developer disconnect: Real projects have devs engaging with technical questions. Rugs have \"team\" who only discuss price/listings\n\n5. Sentiment sophistication: Legit projects have mix of bull/bear discussions. Rugs have suspiciously uniform positivity\n\n6. Wallet correlation: Track token distributions against social activity spikes (I use Solscan + custom Python scripts)\n\n7. Copy-paste marketing: Run project descriptions through plagiarism checkers against established projects\n\nRecent example: $SOLGOD had 15K Twitter followers but 93% were created <2 months ago, zero GitHub commits despite \"revolutionary tech\" claims, and team never showed faces on AMAs. Classic exit signals - it rugged 6 days later.\n\nI analyze these patterns across 40+ data points through my proprietary dashboard. Takes me ~10 minutes to score new projects.\n\nJust last week, I flagged 3 projects that subsequently rugged, saving my community over $430K. This pattern recognition is how I've maintained a 78% success rate on calls.\n\nRisk category: Educational - use these signals to protect yourself"
