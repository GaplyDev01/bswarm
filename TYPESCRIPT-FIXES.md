# TypeScript Fixes for BlockSwarms Deployment

This document outlines the TypeScript errors we fixed to enable successful building of the BlockSwarms project for deployment.

## Summary of Fixes

1. **Fixed Function Name References in AI Chat Page**
   - Changed `getUserId()` to `_getUserId()` to match the actual function name
   - Changed `scrollToBottom()` to `_scrollToBottom()` to match the actual function name
   - Changed `formEvent` to `_formEvent` to match the variable name
   - Changed `baseQuestions` to `_baseQuestions` to match the variable name
   - Changed `shuffled` to `_shuffled` to match the variable name
   - Changed `handleSuggestedQuestion()` to `_handleSuggestedQuestion()` to match the actual function name

2. **Removed Invalid Runtime Exports**
   - Removed `export const _runtime = 'edge';` from API route files which was causing build errors in Next.js 15

3. **Created Function Reference Checker**
   - Created a script `scripts/check-function-references.js` to automatically detect function name mismatches
   - The script scans the codebase for potential issues where a function is defined with a prefix (like _functionName) but called without the prefix

4. **Created a Type-Safe Logger Utility**
   - Created a production-safe logger in `lib/logger.ts` that properly handles environment checking
   - Replaced problematic conditional console logs with this new logger
   - Resolved circular dependencies by centralizing logging in one module

5. **Removed Duplicate Logger Implementations**
   - Removed the duplicate logger from `lib/utils/logger.ts` that was causing naming conflicts
   - Updated `lib/utils/index.ts` to properly re-export the main logger

6. **Fixed Solana Web3.js Compatibility**
   - Updated `lib/solana/solanaV2.ts` to use Web3.js v1.98.0 API instead of v2 imports
   - Implemented a compatibility wrapper that maintains the same functionality

7. **Fixed Build Process**
   - Updated `scripts/remove-console-logs.js` to exclude the logger utility
   - Created a new script `scripts/fix-typescript-errors.js` to automate TypeScript error fixes

## Key Files Modified

- ✅ `app/ai-chat/page.tsx` - Fixed multiple function name references
- ✅ `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - Removed invalid runtime export
- ✅ `app/api/auth/temp/route.ts` - Removed invalid runtime export
- ✅ `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Removed invalid runtime export
- ✅ `scripts/check-function-references.js` - Created to detect function name mismatches
- ✅ `lib/logger.ts` - Created a new type-safe logger utility
- ✅ `lib/env.ts` - Updated to use the new logger
- ✅ `lib/utils.ts` - Removed duplicate logger implementation
- ✅ `lib/utils/index.ts` - Updated to re-export the main logger
- ✅ `lib/solana/solanaV2.ts` - Fixed to use Web3.js v1.98.0 API

## Build Results

The application now builds successfully without TypeScript errors. The following warnings remain but don't affect functionality:

- `bigint: Failed to load bindings, pure JS will be used (try npm run rebuild?)`
- `[DEP0040] DeprecationWarning: The punycode module is deprecated.`

These warnings are related to dependencies and do not affect the application's functionality.

## Next Steps

1. **Environment Variable Configuration**
   - Set up all required environment variables in Vercel
   - Configure Clerk authentication for the production domain

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Conduct thorough testing of all features
   - Monitor for any runtime errors related to the modified logging system

3. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Consider migrating to ESLint with TypeScript rules to catch similar issues early
   - Implement a pre-commit hook to run the function reference checker
