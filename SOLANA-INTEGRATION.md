# Solana V2 Integration Deployment Guide

This document provides instructions for successfully deploying the Solana V2 integration to Vercel. The integration provides a compatibility layer between Web3.js v1 (required by wallet adapters) and v2-style APIs.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for the Solana V2 integration:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_WSS_URL=wss://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_REAL_SOLANA=true
```

You can customize these values based on your needs:

- For testnet: `https://api.testnet.solana.com` and `wss://api.testnet.solana.com`
- For devnet: `https://api.devnet.solana.com` and `wss://api.devnet.solana.com`
- For local development, you may set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_REAL_SOLANA=false` to use the mock implementation

## Features Implemented

The Solana V2 integration includes:

1. **Compatibility Layer**: A custom implementation that provides v2-style syntax while maintaining compatibility with v1 dependencies
2. **Fallback Mechanism**: Automatic fallback to v1 methods if v2 calls fail
3. **WebSocket Support**: Real-time account and program subscription capabilities
4. **Wallet Integration**: Seamless connection with wallet adapters and account balance tracking
5. **Token Management**: View SPL token balances and transaction history

## Vercel Deployment Steps

1. Ensure all required environment variables are set in your Vercel project settings
2. Deploy using the `build:deploy` script which handles TypeScript compatibility issues
3. Verify deployment by checking the wallet connection functionality
4. Monitor logs for any RPC connection issues

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Solana integration after deployment:

1. **RPC Connection Errors**: Verify that `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL` is correctly set and the RPC endpoint is accessible
2. **WebSocket Issues**: Some RPC providers don't support WebSocket connections. You can omit `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_WSS_URL` if needed
3. **Wallet Connection Problems**: Make sure wallet adapters are correctly initialized on the client side
4. **Performance Issues**: Consider using a dedicated RPC provider like QuickNode, Alchemy, or Triton for better performance

## Future Improvements

For future enhancements to the Solana integration:

1. Add transaction signing and sending capabilities
2. Implement token swap functionality via Jupiter aggregator
3. Add staking and governance participation features
4. Improve error handling and retry mechanisms
5. Add support for compressed NFTs and other program interactions
