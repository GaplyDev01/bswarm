If you're going degen (which I respect), consider 2% portfolio max with tight stops at -12%. I'm personally waiting for a pullback to 0.00000121 range before adding to my position.\n\nNot as explosive as my JITO call last month, but definitely not looking like a rug. Risk:reward ratio currently 1:2.3 - acceptable for meme exposure."

Social traction is artificially pumped - I'm seeing batch-created Twitter accounts all posting similar hype.\n\nStay far away from this garbage.

Technical approach:\n   - Enter on key support levels with volume confirmation\n   - Multiple time frame analysis before every entry\n   - Trailing stops at 0.5 ATR below local structure\n\n4. Sentiment edge:\n   - Track exchange inflows/outflows for institutional positioning\n   - Monitor developer GitHub activity as leading indicator\n   - Analyze community engagement quality not just quantity\n\n5. Risk management non-negotiables:\n   - No more than 15% portfolio in high-risk assets\n   - Clear invalidation points on EVERY trade\n   - Take partial profits at predetermined levels\n\nThis strategy kept me profitable through 72% market drawdown in 2022. Boring? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely."

        "content": "Social signals that scream \"incoming rug\" that most traders miss:\n\n1. Engagement mismatch: High like counts but minimal unique replies (botting)\n\n2. Account archaeology: Check follower accounts - sudden batches created within same 48hr window = red flag\n\n3. Uniformity patterns: Natural communities have varied message lengths/styles. Too similar = fabricated\n\n4. Developer disconnect: Real projects have devs engaging with technical questions. Rugs have \"team\" who only discuss price/listings\n\n5. Sentiment sophistication: Legit projects have mix of bull/bear discussions. Rugs have suspiciously uniform positivity\n\n6. Wallet correlation: Track token distributions against social activity spikes (I use Solscan + custom Python scripts)\n\n7. Copy-paste marketing: Run project descriptions through plagiarism checkers against established projects\n\nRecent example: $SOLGOD had 15K Twitter followers but 93% were created <2 months ago, zero GitHub commits despite \"revolutionary tech\" claims, and team never showed faces on AMAs. Classic exit signals - it rugged 6 days later.\n\nI analyze these patterns across 40+ data points through my proprietary dashboard. Takes me ~10 minutes to score new projects."
