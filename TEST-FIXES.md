# Test Fixes for BlockSwarms

This document outlines the changes made to fix the test suite after updating the logger implementation.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Logger Implementation Changes**
   - The original logger implementation added prefixes like `[DEBUG]` and `[ERROR]` to log messages.
   - The new implementation removes these prefixes for cleaner output.
   - Test expectations had to be updated to match the new format.

2. **Helper File Organization**
   - The `testHelpers.ts` file was moved to a dedicated `helpers` directory.
   - Jest configuration was updated to ignore the helpers directory to prevent it from being treated as a test file.
   - Import paths were updated in test files that used the helper utilities.

## Test Success Verification

After making these changes, all tests now pass successfully:

```
Test Suites: 7 passed, 7 total
Tests:       44 passed, 44 total
Snapshots:   0 total
```

## Remaining Warnings

The following warnings still appear during test execution but do not affect functionality:

1. **Punycode Deprecation Warning**:
   ```
   [DEP0040] DeprecationWarning: The `punycode` module is deprecated. Please use a userland alternative instead.
   ```
   
   This warning is related to dependencies using the deprecated `punycode` module. It can be addressed in a future update by updating the dependent packages or finding alternatives.

To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

For test coverage:
